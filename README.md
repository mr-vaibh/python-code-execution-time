Installation
-----

You should be able to install using `pip` in the usual ways:

`$ pip install exec-time`

Or just clone this repository and run:

`$ python setup.py install`

Or place the [exec-time]{.title-ref} folder that you downloaded
somewhere where it can be accessed by your scripts.

Usage
=====

Add your code snippets in `first_func` and `second_func` respectively for comparison

``` {.python}
# === USAGE ===
@exec_time
def first_func():
    '''Here goes function 1'''
    x = 0
    for i in range(1, 10001):
        x += 10

@exec_time
def second_func():
    '''Here goes function 2'''
    x = 0
    for i in range(1, 101):
        x += 10

first_func()
second_func()
```

``` {.python}
# === OUTPUT ===
# first_func function executed in : 0.32839999767020345 mil sec
# second_func function executed in : 0.006199989002197981 mil sec
```

That\'s it, enjoy üç∑
